                                            My husband and I were so pleased with the wedding brunch Chef Liz put together for our daughter’s wedding last month and even more importantly, so were the bride and groom. There were about 125 people at the affair. The food was perfect---easy for everyone to eat and all delicious and beautiful. I received so many compliments, I had to use her again for a formal dinner party I had just a week ago. This was a much smaller affair ---dinner for fifteen people who came from all over the country to speak at a conference I chaired the following day. The dinner was exquisite in all respects. I have booked Chef Liz for two holiday events coming up, one in November and one in December. I recommend her highly!

                                            Beyond our expectations and exactly what we wanted! We checked out several catering options but Sprig was the only one that understood our vision and gave us exactly what we wanted, not just the cookie cutter options that most catering services come up with. We wanted to do a few different types of food that we have come to love; an Indian option, steak tacos and then the typical chicken dish for our less adventurous guests. Sprig was the only caterer that said, "Yes, we can do that... and here is how". Liz worked with us from the beginning and her attention to the details made our wedding food memorable and talked about. One of our vendors said that our wedding food was the best food he's ever had at a wedding (and he’s attended hundreds of weddings). And to top it off the way our food stations were displayed was absolutely stunning. We had a difficult color scheme to work with but without hesitation Liz made it work. She called her linen vendors and provided us several samples to view. She carefully selected the perfect combination ensuring that everything turned out better than we could have imagined.

                                            I had the pleasure of hiring Chef Liz of Sprig Catering to put on a cooking class for ten of my clients. It was a huge success! Chef Liz taught us how to make some tasty appetizers and she made the event casual and fun. If you are looking for a unique way to entertain some of your clients at a reasonable price, I highly recommend Sprig Catering. I plan to use them again for future events. Thanks Sprig!

                                            Bob Stefani and I thank you for the excellent job you and your staff did at our five recent Networking events.Both you and your staff were highly professional and great to work with. We got rave reviews about the various menus you recommended. The food presentation at each event was beautiful. We will certainly recommend your company to others. I believe that several people have inquired and plan to use you in the near future.

                                            Sprig Catering recently catered a bridal shower in our home. The menu was delicious, creatively displayed, and the service was excellent. Everything was taken care of from start to finish so we could enjoy our guests. I would highly recommend Liz and her team. Our guests, and especially the bride, where delighted.
